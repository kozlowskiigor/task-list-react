### **Add new task field**
You can fill in the input field to add task to the task list.

### **Add new task button**
When then input field is filled clicking teal button which is located on the right will add this task to the list below.

## **Task list**
**Adding a task by pressing the button will cause it to appear on the list below between two buttons.**

Green button on the left is a marker that shows if the task is completed or not. After adding a task it is empty, when we click on it, we will mark the task as completed and the task will be crossed out and the cross mark will apear inside the button. We can click it again both strikethrough and the check mark will disappear changing our task "to complete".

Red button on the right with trash can icon is used to delete completed tasks from our list.

**Two more buttons appear to the right of "Lista zadań" when at least one task is added to the list.**

First "Ukryj ukończone" is used to hide tasks that are marked as completed. After hiding the tasks the inscription "Ukryj ukończone" will change to "Pokaż ukończone" which will show completed tasks back on the list.

Second "Ukończ wszystkie" is used to mark all tasks from the list as completed.

The added tasks will be saved in local storage, so when you refresh or reopen the page you will see your last changes.

# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
